UofT Building API
=================

This is a RESTful web API built to interface with the University of Toronto buildings across all 3 campuses.
It is developed as part of a collection of open data APIs for UofT called [Carbon](https://carbon.qas.im).

For more information on how to use Carbon's APIs, see the [documentation](https://carbon.qas.im/documentation).
